## Configure extra Organizations in Automation controller

After configuring the base automation controller, the teams (organizations)  
must be added to do the work in controller.  
In this document we describe the actions to be taken to add a new organization to  
controller.  


Adding a team to controller through configuration as code can be done following the  
steps mentioned here:

1. [create git template repo](create_git_template.md)
2. [add team LDAP to base config](add_ldap.md)
3. [create new git repository, based on a template](create_git_repo.md)
4. See user documentation for creating content..
